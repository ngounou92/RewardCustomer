      <p>This web application demonstrates a customer Reward Application on <b>blockchain</b> using <b> Hyperledger Fabric</b></p>

      <br>
      <p>A customer Reward program allows companies to reward customers who frequently make purchases. Customers are able to earn points on purchases, which can translate into some type of reward such as <b>discount, freebie or special customer treatment</b>.
        The Customers work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. These programs can have multiple companies as partners on the application, to cater to a customer base. Indeed, current loyalty program systems are restraint on relations.
        This restraint can be removed by using blockchain technology(hyperledger faric) to join directly the customers and the companies.
        <br><br> This blockchain model for a <b>customer reward program </b> enhances the value of points to loyalty program members and brings in new value to the company by creating trusted transactions. Participants in this network have a more level relation
        among each other and points are in the centric position to connect all participants(customer, companies).
       <!-- <br><br> In this code pattern, we have created a customer reward program as a blockchain web application using hyperledger fabric. The application allow customer <b>to register </b>on the network where they can create their account.
        They are identified on the network with their <b>account number </b> and create a access key which they  use to <b>Login</b> . This access key is used as the card id for the member to make transactions and query records. The customer once signed
        in, can make transactions to earn points and redeem points from the partners on the network. They can view their transactions as part of the blockchain ledger. This code pattern illustrates the use of permissions as part of the network where a custmer can only view their transactions.
        <br><br> Similarly for the companies, they register by creating an identity on the network and an access key which will be used to view their records. Companies are allowed to view only transactions they were part of, and thus can keep track
        of all their transactions where they allocated or redeemed points. The web application shows a basic dashboard for the company displaying the total points that they have allocated and redeemed to members. As transactions get complex, the companies
        can perform analysis on their transactions to create informative dashboards. -->
